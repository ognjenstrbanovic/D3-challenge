# D3-challenge
To me, this was the most difficult unit to learn. It surely had something to do with the fact that we were not in class, and instead learning through a Zoom session. But really, it was a steep learning curve...  
In this HW assignment, I get a new position for a major metropolitan paper. The task is to "analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings". The feature story is "about the health risks facing particular demographics". The dataset that the editor includes is "from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System".  
**The core of what I did was create a scatterplot between two of the data variables.** I chose *Smokers vs. Age*. Each state was to be represented with circle elements (with state abbreviations inside) - this was done in the ```app.js``` file - with data pulled using the ```d3.csv``` function. In addition, axes and labels were added through D3.js, and I used ```python -m http.server``` to run it and avoid a CORS error in the browser.

To me, this is not a very visually appealing plot, even though I did follow the instructions closely and did exactly what was asked of me.  

Anyway, the bonus assignment was one that I was not successful in completing. Disappointing for me... yet and still, I had to remind myself that - only 4 months ago - I didn't know what CSS was, for example!  
Anyway, here is what I learned this week:  

> ***Objectives for *D3.js* Unit:***  
> - Gain a high-level understanding of SVG elements and how to append/modify them using D3.  
> - Understand how to bind data to SVG elements using D3 so as to create basic bar charts from scratch.  
> - Create a bar chart with axes using D3 so as to visualize data.  
> - Create different types of charts and graphs using D3.  
> - Cover scales in greater depth.  
> - Plot multiple columns from a dataset, either simultaneously or in alternation.  
> - Gain a better understanding of reusable code.
